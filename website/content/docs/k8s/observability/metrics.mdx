Consul on Kubernetes integrates with Prometheus and Grafana to provide metrics for Consul Service Mesh, including: service metrics, sidecar proxy metrics, Consul agent metrics, and gateway metrics. Service metrics can also be seen in the Consul UI Topology Visualization view. This section documents how to enable each of these.
